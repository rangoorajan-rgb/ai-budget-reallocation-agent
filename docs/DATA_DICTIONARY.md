# Data Dictionary

> Sprint 1, Development Stage 2 (adds deterministic validation reporting to the Stage 1
> enumerations, numerical constants, core input models, and CSV schema). Derived and
> export fields are pending later stages.

## Input CSV Schema (Google Ads and Meta Ads — shared)

One row per campaign. Google Ads and Meta Ads campaigns share a single CSV schema; the
`platform` column distinguishes them. Column order is fixed and must match exactly —
see `data/campaign_template.csv` and `src/models.py::CampaignInput`.

| # | Column | Type | Required | Description / rules |
|---|--------|------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | `campaign_id` | string | yes | Unique campaign identifier. Trimmed; must not be blank. |
| 2 | `campaign_name` | string | yes | Human-readable campaign name. Trimmed; must not be blank. |
| 3 | `platform` | enum (`Platform`) | yes | `Google Ads` or `Meta Ads`. |
| 4 | `status` | enum (`CampaignStatus`) | yes | `Active` or `Paused`. |
| 5 | `kpi_type` | enum (`KPIType`) | yes | `CPA` or `ROAS` — the objective this campaign is measured against. |
| 6 | `kpi_target` | Decimal (unquantised) | yes | Target CPA or ROAS value. Must be greater than 0. |
| 7 | `current_budget` | Decimal (currency, quantised to `0.01` via `ROUND_HALF_UP`) | yes | Campaign's current budget. Must be ≥ 0, and between `minimum_budget` and `maximum_budget` inclusive. |
| 8 | `minimum_budget` | Decimal (currency) | yes | Lowest budget this campaign may be assigned. Must be ≥ 0. |
| 9 | `maximum_budget` | Decimal (currency) | yes | Highest budget this campaign may be assigned. Must be ≥ `minimum_budget`. |
| 10 | `spend_to_date` | Decimal (currency) | yes | Spend so far in the current review period. Must be ≥ 0 and ≤ `current_budget`. |
| 11 | `conversions_7d` | integer | yes | Conversions in the trailing 7 days. Must be ≥ 0 and ≤ `conversions_28d`. |
| 12 | `conversions_28d` | integer | yes | Conversions in the trailing 28 days. Must be ≥ 0. |
| 13 | `kpi_actual_7d` | Decimal (unquantised) | yes | Actual CPA or ROAS over the trailing 7 days. Must be greater than 0. |
| 14 | `kpi_actual_28d` | Decimal (unquantised) | yes | Actual CPA or ROAS over the trailing 28 days. Must be greater than 0. |
| 15 | `tracking_status` | enum (`TrackingStatus`) | yes | `Healthy`, `Warning`, or `Unreliable`. |
| 16 | `business_priority` | enum (`BusinessPriority`) | yes | `Standard`, `Medium`, or `High`. |
| 17 | `is_protected` | boolean | yes | `True` if this campaign must never be reduced. Accepts literal booleans or case-insensitive `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, `1`/`0`; any other value is rejected as ambiguous. |
| 18 | `is_test_campaign` | boolean | yes | `True` if this is a test campaign subject to a budget floor. Same accepted values as `is_protected`. If `True`, `test_budget_floor` must be set; if `False`, `test_budget_floor` must be blank. |
| 19 | `test_budget_floor` | Decimal (currency) or blank | conditionally | Required and must be ≥ 0 and ≤ `current_budget` when `is_test_campaign` is `True`; must be blank when `is_test_campaign` is `False`. |
| 20 | `campaign_max_change_percentage` | Decimal (unquantised) or blank | no | Per-campaign override of the review's default max change percentage. When supplied, must satisfy `0 < value <= 1`. Blank to use the review default. |

Currency columns (`current_budget`, `minimum_budget`, `maximum_budget`, `spend_to_date`,
`test_budget_floor`) are parsed as `Decimal` and quantised to two decimal places using
`ROUND_HALF_UP`. KPI and percentage columns (`kpi_target`, `kpi_actual_7d`, `kpi_actual_28d`,
`campaign_max_change_percentage`) are parsed as `Decimal` but are **not** quantised — they
keep whatever precision was supplied. Boolean columns accept only the conventional
representations listed above.

## Review Setup Fields (entered by reviewer, not part of the campaign CSV)

Captured once per review via `src/models.py::ReviewSetup`, not uploaded as CSV.

| Field | Type | Required | Description / rules |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| `review_id` | string | yes | Unique identifier for this review. Trimmed; must not be blank. |
| `review_date` | date | yes | Date the review is performed. |
| `period_start` | date | yes | First day of the period under review. |
| `period_end` | date | yes | Last day of the period under review. Must not be before `period_start`. |
| `reviewer_name` | string | yes | Name of the human reviewer. Trimmed; must not be blank. |
| `approved_monthly_budget` | Decimal (currency, quantised to `0.01` via `ROUND_HALF_UP`) | yes | Total approved monthly budget across all campaigns. Must be greater than 0. |
| `initial_account_reserve` | Decimal (currency) | yes | Budget held back from reallocation. Must be ≥ 0 and ≤ `approved_monthly_budget`. |
| `default_max_change_percentage` | Decimal (unquantised) | no (default `0.20`, from `DEFAULT_MAX_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE`) | Default maximum per-campaign change percentage, used when a campaign has no override. Must satisfy `0 < value <= 1`. |
| `review_notes` | string or blank | no | Free-text notes from the reviewer. |

Both `ReviewSetup` and `CampaignInput` reject any field not in the lists above
(`extra="forbid"`).

## Validation Report Fields (`src/validation.py`)

Produced by `validate_review_setup()` and `validate_campaign_csv()`. Not part of the CSV
schema — these are the shapes returned to describe validation outcomes.

### `ValidationIssue`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `severity` | enum (`ValidationSeverity`) | Always `ERROR` for every issue Stage 2 produces. |
| `code` | enum (`ValidationCode`) | One of `INVALID_REVIEW_FIELD`, `EMPTY_FILE`, `INVALID_HEADER`, `NO_CAMPAIGN_ROWS`, `MALFORMED_ROW`, `INVALID_CAMPAIGN_FIELD`, `DUPLICATE_CAMPAIGN_ID`. |
| `field` | string or `None` | Affected field name (dotted if nested), or `None` for file-level/model-level issues with no single field. |
| `message` | string | Human-readable description. Never a raw stack trace or internal exception representation. |
| `row_number` | integer or `None` | Physical one-based CSV line number (header is line 1, first data row is line 2), or `None` for file-level and `ReviewSetup` issues. |
| `campaign_id` | string or `None` | Trimmed `campaign_id` for the affected row, when it could be read; otherwise `None`. |

### `ValidationReport`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `issues` | list of `ValidationIssue` | All issues found, in the order encountered. |
| `valid_campaigns` | list of `CampaignInput` | Successfully validated, non-duplicate campaigns, in original CSV order. |
| `error_count` | integer (computed) | Count of `ERROR`-severity issues. Derived from `issues` on every access; not settable independently. |
| `warning_count` | integer (computed) | Count of `WARNING`-severity issues. Derived from `issues`; always `0` for current Stage 2 outcomes. |
| `is_valid` | boolean (computed) | `True` only when `error_count == 0`. Derived from `issues`; not settable independently. |

`ValidationReport` intentionally has no `review_id` field: invalid raw review input may not
contain a usable review ID.

## Derived Fields

> Pending a later Sprint 1 stage (metrics, pacing, classification, scoring, allocation).

## Export Fields

> Pending a later Sprint 1 stage (`src/exports.py`).
