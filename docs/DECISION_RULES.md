# Decision Rules

> Sprint 1, Development Stage 2. Records the frozen enumerations, frozen numerical
> constants, and the frozen deterministic validation rules. Calculation and allocation
> rules (how these enumerations and constants are used to classify, score, constrain, and
> reallocate budget) are pending later Sprint 1 stages.

## Approved Enumerations (`src/constants.py`)

| Enum | Members and exact values |
|------|---------------------------|
| `Platform` | `GOOGLE_ADS = "Google Ads"`, `META_ADS = "Meta Ads"` |
| `KPIType` | `CPA = "CPA"`, `ROAS = "ROAS"` |
| `CampaignStatus` | `ACTIVE = "Active"`, `PAUSED = "Paused"` |
| `TrackingStatus` | `HEALTHY = "Healthy"`, `WARNING = "Warning"`, `UNRELIABLE = "Unreliable"` |
| `BusinessPriority` | `STANDARD = "Standard"`, `MEDIUM = "Medium"`, `HIGH = "High"` |
| `RecommendationAction` | `INCREASE = "INCREASE"`, `MAINTAIN = "MAINTAIN"`, `REDUCE = "REDUCE"`, `HOLD = "HOLD"` |
| `Confidence` | `HIGH = "HIGH"`, `MEDIUM = "MEDIUM"`, `LOW = "LOW"`, `NOT_ASSESSABLE = "NOT_ASSESSABLE"` |
| `ReviewStatus` | `DRAFT = "DRAFT"`, `PENDING_APPROVAL = "PENDING_APPROVAL"`, `APPROVED = "APPROVED"`, `REJECTED = "REJECTED"` |
| `ValidationSeverity` | `ERROR = "ERROR"`, `WARNING = "WARNING"` |
| `ReasonCode` | `ABOVE_TARGET_STRONG`, `BELOW_TARGET_MODERATE`, `BELOW_TARGET_SEVERE`, `NEAR_TARGET`, `RECENT_TREND_IMPROVING`, `RECENT_TREND_STABLE`, `RECENT_TREND_DECLINING`, `INSUFFICIENT_CONVERSION_VOLUME`, `TRACKING_UNRELIABLE`, `TRACKING_WARNING`, `PROTECTED_FROM_REDUCTION`, `TEST_BUDGET_FLOOR_APPLIED`, `MAX_CHANGE_LIMIT_APPLIED`, `CAMPAIGN_CAP_REACHED`, `CAMPAIGN_FLOOR_REACHED`, `PAUSED_CAMPAIGN`, `NO_ELIGIBLE_RECIPIENT`, `HELD_FOR_MANUAL_REVIEW`, `STRONG_LONG_TERM_RECENT_DECLINE`, `ACCOUNT_RESERVE_REQUIRED` (each member's value is identical to its name) |

`Platform`, `CampaignStatus`, `TrackingStatus`, and `BusinessPriority` use approved
human-readable display strings as their values (matching the CSV schema); `KPIType` and all
other enums use their member name as the value.

## Frozen Numerical Constants (`src/constants.py`)

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `DEFAULT_MAX_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE` | `Decimal("0.20")` |
| `TREND_THRESHOLD` | `Decimal("0.10")` |
| `SEVEN_DAY_WEIGHT` | `Decimal("0.40")` |
| `TWENTY_EIGHT_DAY_WEIGHT` | `Decimal("0.60")` |
| `INCREASE_THRESHOLD` | `Decimal("1.15")` |
| `MAINTAIN_THRESHOLD` | `Decimal("0.90")` |
| `MINIMUM_CONVERSIONS` | `10` |
| `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_CONVERSIONS` | `30` |
| `CURRENCY_QUANTUM` | `Decimal("0.01")` |

These constants are reserved names and values only. No pacing, classification, scoring,
constraint, allocation, or conservation logic reads or applies them yet — that is pending
later Sprint 1 stages.

## Validation Codes (`src/constants.py`)

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `INVALID_REVIEW_FIELD` | A `ReviewSetup` field or cross-field rule was violated. |
| `EMPTY_FILE` | The campaign CSV stream contained no content at all. |
| `INVALID_HEADER` | The CSV header did not exactly match the required `CampaignInput` schema (missing, extra, renamed, reordered, or duplicate column). |
| `NO_CAMPAIGN_ROWS` | The header was valid but no data rows followed it. |
| `MALFORMED_ROW` | A data row had the wrong number of cells (missing or surplus). |
| `INVALID_CAMPAIGN_FIELD` | A `CampaignInput` field or cross-field rule was violated for a structurally well-shaped row. |
| `DUPLICATE_CAMPAIGN_ID` | The same `campaign_id` appeared in more than one structurally valid row. |

`ValidationCode` is distinct from `ReasonCode`: `ValidationCode` describes *input data*
problems found before any recommendation logic runs; `ReasonCode` (pending) will describe
*recommendation/allocation* outcomes. They are never reused for each other's purpose.

## Deterministic Validation Rules (Sprint 1, Development Stage 2)

These rules govern `src/validation.py`, which validates raw `ReviewSetup` input and
campaign CSV data. `ReviewSetup` and `CampaignInput` (`src/models.py`) remain the sole
authoritative source of structural rules — validation.py only invokes them and translates
their `pydantic.ValidationError` output into `ValidationIssue` records; it never
re-implements a rule they already enforce.

- **Header requirement.** The campaign CSV header must exactly equal the 20
  `CampaignInput` field names, in their model-definition order (derived at runtime from
  `CampaignInput.model_fields`, never hand-typed as a second list). Any mismatch —
  missing, extra, renamed, reordered, or duplicate column — produces exactly one
  `INVALID_HEADER` issue at `row_number=1`; no per-column issues are produced, and no row
  validation occurs after an invalid header (`valid_campaigns` is empty).
- **Physical line-number convention.** `row_number` is the physical one-based CSV line
  number: the header is line 1, the first data row is line 2, and so on. File-level and
  `ReviewSetup` issues use `row_number=None`.
- **Empty-file and no-row handling.** A completely empty stream (no header at all)
  produces one `EMPTY_FILE` issue. A stream with a valid header but zero data rows
  produces one `NO_CAMPAIGN_ROWS` issue — this is the expected outcome for
  `data/campaign_template.csv`, which is intentionally header-only. A row with the correct
  cell count but all-blank cells is not treated as "no row" — it is attempted and
  reported via `MALFORMED_ROW`/`INVALID_CAMPAIGN_FIELD` like any other row.
- **Pydantic models are the authoritative structural validators.** For each row,
  `validation.py` converts blank cells to `None` only for the two genuinely optional
  fields (`test_budget_floor`, `campaign_max_change_percentage`), then passes every other
  raw cell value through to `CampaignInput` unchanged. All numeric, enum, boolean,
  budget-bound, conversion-ordering, KPI, and test-budget-floor rules are enforced solely
  by the frozen `CampaignInput`/`ReviewSetup` validators — never duplicated here.
- **Invalid-row continuation.** One invalid row does not stop processing of later rows.
  Each `pydantic.ValidationError` on a row is translated into one `INVALID_CAMPAIGN_FIELD`
  issue per underlying error (so one row can produce multiple issues), the row is excluded
  from `valid_campaigns`, and processing continues.
- **Row-shape rejection.** A data row whose cell count does not equal 20 (missing or
  surplus cells) produces one `MALFORMED_ROW` issue and is not passed to `CampaignInput`.
- **campaign_id attribution.** Where a row has at least one cell, its first cell (trimmed)
  is attached to the issue's `campaign_id` — since `campaign_id` is always column 1, its
  position is stable even when the row is otherwise malformed or invalid.
- **Duplicate handling.** Duplicates are detected only among rows that successfully
  instantiated `CampaignInput` (structurally invalid rows never participate). Comparison
  uses the model's already-trimmed `campaign_id` and is case-sensitive (`CAMP001` and
  `camp001` are distinct). If an ID occurs more than once, every occurrence — not just the
  2nd and later — receives its own `DUPLICATE_CAMPAIGN_ID` issue at its own physical line
  number, and every occurrence is excluded from `valid_campaigns`. Non-duplicate valid
  rows are preserved in original CSV order.
- **Error-only severity policy for Stage 2.** Every issue Stage 2 produces has severity
  `ERROR`. No Stage-2-only `WARNING` rules exist. In particular, `TrackingStatus.WARNING`
  and `TrackingStatus.UNRELIABLE` are valid enum inputs, not validation warnings, and a
  protected or test-campaign state is valid whenever the existing frozen model rules pass.
  `ValidationReport.warning_count` is still generically derived from `issues` (so it would
  reflect a `WARNING`-severity issue if one ever existed), but it is `0` for every outcome
  Stage 2 currently produces.
- **No raw exception leakage.** Where a value is coercible to `Decimal` but an internal
  `decimal` operation (e.g. quantising an extreme value) raises a raw
  `decimal.DecimalException` rather than a `pydantic.ValidationError`, `validation.py`
  catches it and reports one safe, generic issue (`INVALID_REVIEW_FIELD` or
  `INVALID_CAMPAIGN_FIELD`) instead of leaking the internal exception. No other exception
  types are broadly suppressed.

## Pending

- How `TREND_THRESHOLD`, `SEVEN_DAY_WEIGHT`, and `TWENTY_EIGHT_DAY_WEIGHT` combine to assess
  recent performance trend.
- How `INCREASE_THRESHOLD` and `MAINTAIN_THRESHOLD` classify a campaign's KPI performance
  into a `RecommendationAction`.
- How `MINIMUM_CONVERSIONS` and `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_CONVERSIONS` map to `Confidence` levels.
- How `DEFAULT_MAX_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE` and per-campaign overrides constrain a recommended
  budget change.
- The full set of `ReasonCode` trigger conditions.
- Allocation and conservation rules.
