# Current Sprint

**Active sprint:** Sprint 1 — Development
**Status:** Active (Development Stage 1 complete, Development Stage 2 complete)
**Reference:** See [MASTER_PROJECT_PLAN.md](MASTER_PROJECT_PLAN.md) for the full frozen plan.

The repository foundation (directory structure, root project files, placeholder modules,
and initial project-management documentation) is complete and is not re-tracked here.

## Development Stage 1 — Enumerations, Frozen Constants, Core Input Models, CSV Schema (complete)

- [x] `src/constants.py` — frozen `str, Enum` enumerations: `Platform`, `KPIType`,
      `CampaignStatus`, `TrackingStatus`, `BusinessPriority`, `RecommendationAction`,
      `Confidence`, `ReviewStatus`, `ValidationSeverity`, `ReasonCode`. Plus nine frozen
      numerical constants (`DEFAULT_MAX_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE`, `TREND_THRESHOLD`,
      `SEVEN_DAY_WEIGHT`, `TWENTY_EIGHT_DAY_WEIGHT`, `INCREASE_THRESHOLD`,
      `MAINTAIN_THRESHOLD`, `MINIMUM_CONVERSIONS`, `HIGH_CONFIDENCE_CONVERSIONS`,
      `CURRENCY_QUANTUM`). No decision, calculation, or allocation logic.
- [x] `src/models.py` — exactly two input-focused Pydantic v2 models: `ReviewSetup` and
      `CampaignInput`, enforcing only safe, model-level type and structural rules. No
      validation workflow, metrics, pacing, classification, constraints, scoring,
      allocation, or conservation logic.
- [x] Exact 20-field CSV schema for `CampaignInput`, fixed column order, approved
      human-readable enum values.
- [x] `data/campaign_template.csv` (header only) and `data/sample_campaigns.csv` (4 rows).
- [x] `tests/test_models.py` — 92 tests, all passing.
- [x] `docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` and `docs/DECISION_RULES.md` updated.

## Development Stage 2 — Deterministic Validation Reporting (complete)

- [x] `src/constants.py` — added `ValidationCode` enum (`INVALID_REVIEW_FIELD`,
      `EMPTY_FILE`, `INVALID_HEADER`, `NO_CAMPAIGN_ROWS`, `MALFORMED_ROW`,
      `INVALID_CAMPAIGN_FIELD`, `DUPLICATE_CAMPAIGN_ID`). `src/models.py` left unchanged.
- [x] `src/validation.py` — `ValidationIssue` and `ValidationReport` models;
      `validate_review_setup(data)` and `validate_campaign_csv(stream)`. Both functions
      only invoke `ReviewSetup`/`CampaignInput` and translate their
      `pydantic.ValidationError` output into `ValidationIssue` records — no structural
      rule is re-implemented outside `src/models.py`.
- [x] CSV header must exactly match `CampaignInput.model_fields` order (derived at
      runtime, never hand-typed); any mismatch is one file-level `INVALID_HEADER` issue
      with no row validation afterward.
- [x] Row-level parsing: physical one-based line numbers (header = line 1), malformed row
      shapes rejected as `MALFORMED_ROW`, blank optional cells (`test_budget_floor`,
      `campaign_max_change_percentage`) converted to `None`, every other cell passed
      through unmodified to `CampaignInput` for authoritative validation.
- [x] Duplicate `campaign_id` detection among structurally valid rows only — every
      occurrence flagged and excluded, case-sensitive, compared after model trimming.
- [x] All Stage 2 issues are `ValidationSeverity.ERROR`; `warning_count` remains
      generically derived but is `0` for every currently authorised outcome.
- [x] `tests/test_validation.py` — 44 tests, all passing. `tests/test_models.py` (Stage 1)
      unchanged and still passing.
- [x] `docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, `docs/DECISION_RULES.md`, `docs/TEST_SCENARIOS.md`
      updated.

## Explicitly Out of Scope for Stage 2 (and not yet started)

- CPA/ROAS metric calculations (`src/metrics.py`).
- Pacing, classification, constraints, scoring, allocation, conservation.
- Streamlit interface, Gemini integration, approval workflow, audit, exports.
- Tests for any of the above.

## Next Stage

Stage 3 (not started): metric calculations (`src/metrics.py`).
